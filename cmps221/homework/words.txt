I
was
at
the
store
one
particularly
#adjective
day.
Inside,
the
cashier
appeared
to
be
#ajective
yet
#adjective.
The
#noun
she
wore
wasn't
exactly
#adjective.
I
#verb
her
and
she
#verb
me.
I
asked
her
where
I
could
find
a
#noun.
That
upset
her
and
she
threw
a
#noun
at
me.
I
grabbed
the
nearest
#noun
and
#verb
it.
Yeah,
not
going
back
to
that
store.
