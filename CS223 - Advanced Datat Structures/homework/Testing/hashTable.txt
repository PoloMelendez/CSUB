Hash Tables
	
	Items stored in hash table have a unique identifier.
	
	HashCode : an int of an item. If item's unique identifier is
		   an integer, that identifier can be used as it's
		   hash code. If the identifier is not an int, use
		   any function to convert the non-integer to an int.
	ex:   Smith 1968 03 15

	Hash() : converts a hash code into an index of the array
		       which we will call hash table.

	collision : if two or more different hash codes convert into
		    same index of the hash table.

	use 10 as the size for testing purposes.

	collision handling method : 
	1. Overflowed area

	distance( current add, home add )
